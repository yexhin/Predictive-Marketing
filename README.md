This will be achieved using unsupervised machine learning models (K-means) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality.
-The dataset contains 2,019,501 rows and 12 columns, detailing the consumer behavior of customers in Hunter's market.

## Usage:
This project is designed to be completed in the following steps:
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
